# Project 3 — Vite + React

A small Vite + React starter project (created from the default Vite React template). It includes a minimal app, basic global styles, and a component stylesheet for `App`.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended LTS). Use your preferred Node version manager if needed.
- npm (or `pnpm` / `yarn` if you prefer — adjust commands accordingly).

## Setup

Open a terminal in the project root and run:

```powershell
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```powershell
npm run build

# Preview the production build locally
npm run preview
```
